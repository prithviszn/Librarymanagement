## Soroban Smart Contract for Library Management System

## Vision
This project envisions a future where libraries leverage blockchain technology to create a more efficient, transparent, and accessible system for managing books and resources. By using the Stellar network and the Soroban smart contract platform, we aim to:

**Decentralize Ownership**: Enable libraries to have verifiable ownership of their digital book catalogs and lending records.
**Enhance Transparency:** Provide a tamper-proof record of book availability, borrowing history, and administrative actions.
**Simplify Operations:** Streamline book lending and returning processes through automated smart contracts.
**Reduce Costs:** Lower administrative overhead by automating tasks and reducing the reliance on manual record-keeping.
**Improve Accessibility:** Create a more open and accessible system for patrons to discover and borrow books.
Project Overview
This Soroban smart contract lays the foundation for a decentralized library management system. It implements core functionalities such as:

**Adding Books:** Librarians (or designated administrators) can add new books to the library's digital catalog, specifying ISBN, title, author, and availability status.
Borrowing Books: Patrons can borrow available books, automatically updating the book's availability status.
Returning Books: Patrons can return borrowed books, making them available for others to borrow.
Listing Available Books: A function to retrieve a list of all currently available books.
Features
Real-time Updates: Instantly reflects changes in book availability as they occur.
Immutable Records: Provides a tamper-proof history of book transactions.
Secure Access Control: Ensures only authorized personnel can manage the book catalog.
Extensible: Designed for future expansion with features like member management, reservations, and more.
Technical Details

Soroban SDK: Leverages the Soroban smart contract development kit for Stellar.
Stellar Network: Utilizes the Stellar blockchain for secure and transparent data storage.
Rust Programming Language: Built with Rust for performance and safety.
Getting Started
Prerequisites: Ensure you have the Soroban CLI and Rust toolchain installed.
Compilation: Compile the contract using the soroban contract build command.
Deployment: Deploy the compiled contract to the Stellar Testnet or Futurenet using the soroban contract deploy command.

Interaction: Use the Soroban CLI or a custom front-end application to interact with the deployed contract.
Future Enhancements

**Member Management:** Implement user registration, authentication, and tracking of borrowed books.
Reservations: Allow patrons to reserve books that are currently unavailable.
Late Fees: Automatically calculate and enforce late fees for overdue books.
Search Functionality: Enable searching the catalog by title, author, or ISBN.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the library system.
